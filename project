Forex Prediction System - Project Overview
Project Description
This Forex Prediction System is a machine learning-powered web application that provides currency pair predictions, risk assessments, and leverage recommendations for forex traders. The system combines traditional machine learning models with deep learning (LSTM) to analyze historical forex data and generate trading insights.

Key Features
1. Multi-Model Prediction Engine
XGBoost: Gradient boosted trees for robust predictions

Random Forest: Ensemble method for stable performance

Logistic Regression: Simple but effective baseline model

LSTM Neural Network: Deep learning model for capturing temporal patterns

2. Technical Indicators
Moving Averages (10-period)

Relative Strength Index (RSI 14-period)

Price volatility measurements

Return calculations

3. API Endpoints
/predict: Receives market data and returns predictions

/health: System status monitoring endpoint

4. Risk Management
Three-tier risk classification (High/Medium/Low)

Dynamic leverage recommendations based on:

Model confidence levels

Current market volatility

Technical indicators
